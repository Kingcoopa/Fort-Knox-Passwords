## Fort-Knox Password Generator

## Why this web app is important
Information protection is a very hot topic, in todays world. Everyday there is possible threats that could compromise the 
security of your social media accounts, bank accounts computers, etc. Maintaining new and complex passwords for all your accounts 
is a mandatory practice. This web app takes all the think ing out of making passwords. All it takes is one click, and you have a 20 
character password. All you have to do after that is cut and paste. Oh, you also have to remember said passwords.


## Description of the project
This project came with the HTML, CSS, and JS files attached. When ever the password generator was initially lauched, it would not function
properly. After assessing the code, I noticed the HTML and CSS files were coded properly. All I did was customize a little bit of the styling.
The real work was going to be fixing the JS code.
